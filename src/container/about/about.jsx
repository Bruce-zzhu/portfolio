                                engineering student at the University of
                                Melbourne, pursuing to become a &nbsp;
                                <span>software developer</span> in the future.
                            </strong>
                            <br />
                            <br />I fell in love with development when I built
                            my first website in a coding competition. I
                            believe&nbsp;
                            <strong>
                                creation is the beauty of programming&nbsp;
                            </strong>
                            and I enjoy building projects and creating awesome
                            products with my own hand. <br />
                            <br />
                            As a proactive student, apart from interacting with the computer, I also like socialising with people by participating in club activities, community volunteering activities, student programs, etc. <br/>
                            <br />
                            In my leisure time, I like playing badminton and
                            guitar as my hobbies, or implementing my project
                            ideas for fun.
