                                Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Bruce Zhu, a passionate software
                                engineer working at a tech company, responsible for developing web and mobile applications.
                            </strong>
                            <br />
                            <br />I fell in love with development when I built
                            my first website in a coding competition. I
                            believe&nbsp;
                            <strong>
                                creation is the beauty of programming&nbsp;
                            </strong>
                            and I enjoy building projects and creating awesome
                            products with my own hand. <br />
                            <br />
                            As a proactive individual, apart from interacting with the computer, 
                            I enjoy meeting with people through social events, coffee catchup, community volunteering, etc. <br/>
                            <br />
                            In my leisure time, I like playing badminton and
                            guitar as my hobbies, or implementing my project
                            ideas for fun.
